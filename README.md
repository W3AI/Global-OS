[live nTeams PoC 0.3](https://teamhub.w3ai.net)

nTeams/TeamHub is the core nGene dev app for building distributed evolutionary social networks for businesses, communities and professionals.
It consists of a trinity of modules that add realtime interactions to build the progressive nature of your network:

### nGenes + nProjects = nVentures

nTeams is being built to be used on any mobile device or desktop or as a side app to Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

The nTeams web app is developed dynamically by Agile teams of volunteers from the W3AI Meetups network in:
- Toronto - [TCP1P - Transformative Code Pile 1 Programing Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SocialAI/)
- New York - [Manhatan AIR - Algorithmic Innovations Reactor](https://www.meetup.com/Manhattan-AIR/)
- Halifax - [AIG - Halifax Algorithmic Innovation Group](https://www.meetup.com/HalifaxAIG/)

Team up with us to build together the fastest social business networks meant to solve world's top voted problems.
